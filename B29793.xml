            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

In the yeare 1439 Amurath the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour came before Senderyn, situated on the Donaw being a Citie belonging to Georg Despota; Lord of that Country, who durst not attend the Turkes comming, but fled out of the Citie, leaving his two Sonnes therein, to defend the same: Hee wrote to the Emperour for assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but it was then too late, for the Sarasens soone tooke the said place in by a storme, and caused the said two Sonnes Eyes to be put out, and afterwards to be guelded, putting to the Sword besides all the inhabitants. Anno 1441 Iohn Huniadar Corvinus (whose Father was a native Wallachian, but his Mother a Grecian Woman) being the Emperours Generall in Transilvania; cut off in a Village 20000 Turkes, amongst whome was killed the Turkish Bashaw and his Sonne, whose heads Corvinus caused to be stuck upon a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon

Anno 1445 <hi>Corvinus</hi> was made Vice-Roy of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who having confederated himselfe with the Prince
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205196:5"/> Scanderbeg, did in the yeare 1448 cut of 34000 Turkes in three dayes space, but the last day the Dice turned and <hi>Corvinus</hi> with many Christians where beaten, and hee in his flight being attacqued by two Murtherers (who both quarrelled about the faire and great Gold Crosse which hunge about his Necke, <hi>Corvinus</hi> wrung one of their Scymiters out of their hands, wherewith hee killed the one of them and caused the other (having disarmed him) to fly: hee retyring himselfe, was by <hi>Despota</hi> taken prisoner and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, until hee had delivered over his Sonn Uladislaus as Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; But hee did shortly after well reward the <hi>Despota</hi> by visiting him, with an Army, so that the <hi>Despota</hi> was glad (with many gifts and presents) to restore him his Sonne againe. Anno 1452 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> silently retired into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where King <hi>Æ²ladislaus</hi> (who now was but 12 yeares old) reigned, to whom hee resigned up his Vice-Royship of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> but the King would perforce that hee should keep it, and gave him also the Earldome or County of <hi>Bistrice:</hi> which great honor the Earle of <hi>Celien</hi> envying, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused <hi>Corvinus</hi> as if hee aspired to the Crowne of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and sought the life of his Majesty; but <hi>Corvinus</hi> being advertised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did so cunningly worke himselfe through all these obstacles, that the Accuser was imprisoned, and hee triumphantly continued in his honour.

Both agree with 24 Spanish soldiers, to surprise some Towres of the City, and order several Troops to be in a readiness, neer to the gates of the Citie of <hi>Bintz,</hi> and that night it was observed that the River was swel'd so high, that it was never knowne before in the memory of the eldest in the Citie, at which the Monck himself was not a little troubled; in the morning as the Moncks Waggons did usualy goe out of the gates of the Citie, for provisions, severall <hi>Heyduks</hi> cloathed in turkish habits to hyde their Armes, came into the Cittie, and <hi>Palavici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> attended with some trustie spanish Soldiers, came very early to the Moncks Lodgings, desiring to speak with the Monck, having in their company (for to avoyd suspition) an other Spaniard who was the Moncks Secretary, who having a letter in his hand, was immediatly admitted into the Moncks Chamber: <hi>Palavicino</hi> stepping after, held the dore so that it might not be shut againe, the Secretary comming to the Monck, who was leaning upon a Table in his night-Gowne, desired leave of him to goe with the Marckgraef <hi>Palavicino</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and if hee pleased to command him any service thither, giving him the letter he carryed in his hand, and desiring him to read it, which while the Monck was doing, the Secretary being behind him, strooke this Monck with his Dagger upon the shoulder, soe that it came throw his breast and out neere his throat whereupon the Monck creyed out <hi>O Iesu Mary:</hi> and struck the Secretary upon his breast, insomuch that hee fell backward against the corner of the Table, the Marquis hearing the noyse, Suddenly stepped with his naked sword into the Chamber, and with a mighty blow cleft his head asunder, the other Spanyards entering in, killed him outright, after hee had first bitterly wept, <hi>O Iesus Mary our Lady: my deare bretheren where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205196:9"/> doe you this?</hi> Thus punished God one by the other: those who murthered the Monck remained not unpunished, for <hi>Palavicino</hi> was taken Prisoner by the Turkes, and caried away into Slavery: two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them was beheaded in France, an other was for his falshood quartered, and an other was killed by a wild Boar: And the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Transilvania</hi> fell afterwards into greater misery then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: The Turkish Emperour understanding the Moncks death, who had been very serviceable to him in many things (to the prejudice of Christendume) became very sorrowfull, and the more, because the Christians became masters of all the Moncks fortresses and riches, whereupon hee in his turkish wrath, swore by Mahomet to avenge the same upon <hi>Transilvania,</hi> for it vexed him sorely, that 250000 Crownes which the said Monck left behinde him, and also 50000 Crownes lying amongst the Officers at <hi>Bints, VVaradyn, Vivar</hi> and <hi>Deve,</hi> came into the hands of the Christians: although the German Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did very justly command, that all such summes as hee had in his life time taken from the Queene, should be again payd unto her, out of the Moncks relict goods, and did also out of the same goods richly reward those who murthered the Monck, and did cause the rest of the Gold and Silver to be melted, and Hungary money to be coyned thereof, which peeces or kinde of mony as being of good allowance, did long afterwards cause the Hungary Ducats and smaller pieces to be well esteemed of. On the other side the Pope was angry that the Emperours Folkes had killed the Monck, and did therefore despise the Emperours Embassadours, hee thinking it to be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible thing, that because he had given the Moncke a Cardinalls hat, he was therefore virtuous in all his dealings, as if that understanding and virtue were entailed to that dignity, and hee caused the Emperour, for that cause to be sharply reprehended, that hee caused a person so well qualified, and renowned in Europe, to bee murthered. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as an obedient Sonn of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> fearing to enrage the Pope promised to demonstrate the just demerit of the Monck, and that the manifold villanies by him committed were more then certain enough, but it availed nought, because the Pope required that they should have made him Heire of the Monks Estate, for he sent to that end three expresse Legates from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Austria,</hi> that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205196:9"/> they should send him over a true Inventory of all the Moncks relict goods; But the Germans answered the couvetous Legates, that the Military persons were paid therewith, and that there was not so much found, as they had made the Pope beleeve. This did the Legates write over to the Pope, who being thereby the more inraged, said, that the sinns of the Murtherers of the Monck, should never be forgiven: notwithstanding that there were severall originall Letters shewed to the said Legates, which the said Moncke had in his lifetime, (to the shame of the Christians) exchanged with the Turkes, in one of which amongst the rest, stood written as followeth, <hi>That he had agreed with</hi> Solyman <hi>the Turkish Emperour, that he should have caused him (although but a Monck) to be crowned King of</hi> Hungary, <hi>and that alone with this condition, that hee should pay but a small Tribute to Solyman.</hi> In the meane while, the Turke accordingly as hee had threatned presently invaded <hi>Transilvania,</hi> taketh <hi>Temeswar, Sobuch</hi> and <hi>Solnoch;</hi> besieged <hi>Erlan,</hi> in which place, the Woman aswell as the Men demonstrated their courage, for defence of their Countrie, for they made in the Citie a mutuall and solemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that end one with another: 1. That upon paine of death no peace should be made with the Turkes, 2. That no man should yield themselves to the Turkes, 3. Neither give any other answer to them then by shooting against them, 4. That if by famine they were compelled to each others Flesh; that it should be noe sham to any one. 5. That Woman as well as Men should worke at the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the releife of sicke and wounded persons. 6. That for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all treason it was ordered that but 3 or 4 persons should assemble together, or talke privatly, being alwayes mindefull how they ought to fight for their Countrey. 7. That all provisions should be to each one equally divided. 8. That all Poultrey and choisest fare, should be onely preserved for the sicke and wounded persons: Those of <hi>Erlan</hi> being thus resolved, did manfully resist thirteen most bloody Stormes; and although <hi>Mahomet Bashaw</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them all favours and Priviledges, yet they contemned the same, and gave no other answer unto his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Anno 1570 a Peace was concluded, between the German Emperour and the Turkish Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: And the Turkish Emperour <hi>Sultan Selym,</hi> having reigned eight yeares deceased, almost about the same time, when <hi>Rudolphus</hi> was made King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Anno 1576 dyed the Emperour <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> at the dyet at <hi>Regensburgh,</hi> when as the truce with the Turkes was prolonged from eight to sixteen yeares: Anno 1586, was all along the River <hi>Donaw</hi> a great famine, and foure yeare after happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eight or 9 Earthquakes. Then came <hi>Hasan Bashaw</hi> of <hi>Bosnia</hi> before <hi>Canisa,</hi> by <hi>Isdrin,</hi> dissembling at first not to take the place, but marched up against the Cloyster of <hi>Zagabria,</hi> which he battered with 24 pieces of Cannon, but because the said Cloyster was soe

            <p>This bitter and Antichristian Letter was presently put into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by the destruction of many Townes &amp; Villages in <hi>Hungary,</hi> after that they in <hi>August</hi> last, had first of all besieged the Fortress called <hi>Vesprin,</hi> where they missed their aime, by reason that the great Cannon and vigillancy of the Count <hi>Seryn</hi> rowsed them away; by which meanes the <hi>Bashaw</hi> and the rest of the Turks councell of Warr resolved to besiege some considerable place over the <hi>Donaw;</hi> upon the 11 of <hi>August</hi> 1663 they fall upon the famous Fortress of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausell,</hi> which lyeth in a Morasse, in which Count <hi>Forgats</hi> an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian had the Command, who but lately before was unfortunatly beaten by the Turkes, in their passage over the <hi>Donaw;</hi> they first stormed the Cittie neare the Vienna Towre, and made their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters round about the same, namely on the Austrian side on the right hand, lay with his quarter <hi>Becho Bashaw Grand Visier</hi> of <hi>Offen,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nine Batteries, of three demy Cannon, and five whole Cannon, on the left side of <hi>Newhausell,</hi> had <hi>Aly Bashaw</hi> his quarter, with two Faulcons, and two demy Cannons, and several small pieces: at the Tower of <hi>Gran</hi> the <hi>Bashaw Captain</hi> had his quarter with 3 Faulcons:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:205196:17"/> The fourth quarter lay on the left hand of the above mentioned, under the Command of the <hi>Janisaries, Agasay,</hi> with one Falcon and two demy Cannons, having round about the Fortresse Batteries, at the end of euery fifty paces. Now at that time those of <hi>Moravia</hi> began first to see the wrath of God, and the certainty of his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Comet here before mentioned, which appeared in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: And it was also well known to those in the Countrey, in the Village <hi>Dillein,</hi> lying a quarter of a mile from <hi>Schomnits,</hi> one of the mountain Citties, upon the fourteeneth of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1663, a Sowe brought forth a Monster, the upper part thereof had wholy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of a Woman, with faire and long curled haire, which hung over the eyes, and had a great bunch like a plume of Feathers upon the head; altogether of the same fashion as the prowd Ladyes in <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> used to wear the same year; on the feet of this young Swine were seene the new fashioned horne shooes, and other figures of pride. And in the Imperiall Citie <hi>Vienna,</hi> by a small Rocket of wild fire, which fell downe upon a Stable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was much Haye, many Houses were turned into ashes; which was a warning piece: the Turkes (who all knew to make use of occasions) had in their comming the Hungarians to be their friends; which people consisting of many Protestants, both Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, Lutherans, and others, were by the rage of the Jesuites depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both of the freedome of their Conscience and use of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; these Hungarians, seeing that that the Romish Clergy were so much regarded in the Imperiall Court, and that they (as Beggars) were alwayes put off with a slight answer, did afterwards more and more turne themselves to the Turkes who having now mastered <hi>VVaradin</hi> and <hi>Transilvania</hi> let the People remaine in the Countrey, taking a civil Tribute, and suffered each to enjoye his Conscience and Religion without any incumbrances; they did therefore think by reason that the Emperour could not defend <hi>Transylvania</hi> against the Turkes, (and that the storme would fall upon <hi>Hungary</hi>) that it was better to receive a Prince who could defend them, and give them liberty of Conscience, then one who wanted power, and seemed to force them in their Conscience. The Emperour well perceiving which way the tide would turne, appeared presently in a Dyet or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205196:18"/> Councell at <hi>Presbourgh;</hi> where the Councell-chamber oftentimes shooke with many high words and protestations, yet in vaine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pacifying any discontents, for the Hungarians told him plainly, that they could not assist, unless their Priviledges and Churches were restored as in former time; whereunto the Romish Ecclesiasticks were not inclined: And by this meanes the Turkes invaded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> to the great astonishment and distruction of many thousand Soules, who were thereby slaine, and carried into captivity. The Tartars had one body of 15000 Horsemen, and the Turkes two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of 40000 men, and 36000 which they kept on the other side of the <hi>Donaw,</hi> and whilst they were busie in bringing the Cannon before <hi>Newhausell;</hi> these bodyes came into severall places, burning <hi>Shaumey</hi> and <hi>Gran,</hi> and the faire and pleasant <hi>Beckenso:</hi> The Tartars in the meane while get over the Water called the <hi>VVaag,</hi> where one <hi>Elias Thasie</hi> an Hungarian with some Troopes lay, for defence, but hee seeing them come, did not expect nor stay for the Enemy, but deserted the same, and most shamefully rann away. The Tartars comming into the Mountainous places, got great booty by their plundering <hi>St George, Tesing</hi> and <hi>Derduke,</hi> and from thence they come into <hi>Moravia,</hi> in somuch, that the Jesuits at <hi>Olmits</hi> could see by day and by night many fires of those Villages, which they every night turned into ashes; the Tartars burned also the faire Cities of <hi>Passing, Thouron, Moron,</hi> and <hi>Æ²rystalein,</hi> and in <hi>Moravia</hi> more then 60 Townes and Villages, cutting in pieces many old People and young Children, and carrying away many thousands of young men and Women into captivity to be sould, whom they sent into chaynes to Tartary and Turkey: These miserable Captives they carry to both their Marketts, and looke both Man and Woman in the mouth and in the teeth, (as they doe the Horses in the Netherlands) how old they are, which accordingly are bought at high or low prices: now was every one afraid (as they had cause,) of this barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion; The Citie <hi>Presburgh</hi> was overfilled with people, who fled away, in somuch, that from thence were presently sent away into <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> all the Women and Children; for this Citie which was but provided only for an encounter, (yet fortified with a Castle) saw no possibillity of keeping out the Turkes by maine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205196:18"/> force; yea at <hi>Vienna</hi> it selfe, people without number, which were fled, lay before the Gates and Bridge, which could not be let in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the said Bridges by so much thronging of flying Waggons, Cartes, Houses, and people, was broken downe: The misery of these people was very great, one telling that as hee fled, hee saw by the way such and such noble Mans Houses, Castles, pleasure Houses and Villages on fire, further that he had seen by the way, old Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Lords and others cut in pieces and stripped, the one whole and the other halfe plundered, some fallen upon and murthered, lying under wheeles of Carts and Waggons, some as they were setting at table, others in their Beds, and as they were asleepe, were fallen upon and murthered: They were the happiest, who flying day and night could in time escape with their lives, leaving behinde them the rich Copper mines, which are by <hi>Newhausell,</hi> and the greene Water which falls there (which is well kowne to Paynters) also the rare Bathes of <hi>Missia</hi> and <hi>Crauschin,</hi> and the healthfull warme spring lying on the water <hi>VVaag,</hi> together with the delicious Carpes and other well tasted Fish in the River <hi>Tibisen,</hi> and forgetting the trade of the Townes and Hills, the bleatings of the multitudes of Sheepe, the gathering of Wooll, and making of the most renowned Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Cloathes, neither could now the searchers of Nature have time to trouble themselves to enquire, what sort of Poyson lyes hid in a place of the earth, by the Hills of <hi>Newhausell,</hi> that whatsoever Bird flieth over the same dyeth, or else wherefore the water of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine neare <hi>Leewa,</hi> assoone as it springeth out turneth into Stone, or why the water of the Fountaine <hi>Smolints</hi> consumeth Iron, and caused a horseshooe which hade been therin 24 houres to be as soft as mud. That the Inhabitans make Copper of Cypres, And why Vitriol of the flower of Copper, and Salte Fountains growe. There were now other things to thinke of, and great feare. And yet could not the German Deputyes at <hi>Regensburgh</hi> in the Diet, or Councel agree to assist the Emperour: some Princes sent many small Troopes but these came so slowly on, as the <hi>Donaw</hi> floweth in the heate of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hardly knowing whether to runn backward or forwards: on the other side all sortes of Antichristian Enemys flowed abundantly in the Emperours hereditary Countryes, beholding now before
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:205196:19"/> them a Treasure of rich Prey left open to them. The Son of the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> came himselfe, with 163 Standards into <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> (being as was beleeved) thereunto induced by the approaching Booty. The <hi>Weywooda</hi> of <hi>Wallachia,</hi> with a Company of 600 tall fellows with red Coates about him for his Guard, armed only with Bowes and Arrows, otherwise so slightly and pitifully moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like unto unarmed Grasshoppers, lame horses, and halting Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: These and the <hi>Bashaw</hi> of <hi>Erlan,</hi> came also together, and went to <hi>Pest</hi> over the <hi>Donaw</hi> towards <hi>Lewents,</hi> and the Mountain Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: where these poore people having no Mills to grinde, were forced to eate their Corne greene, but many by weariness and famine fell downe, by the high way, which by reason of the great raine were become very wet: they had in their Leaguer the greatest Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Cannon drawne by 70 Buffels or Oxen, which shot a 96 pound Bullet; this piece broke, and killed many <hi>Janisaries</hi> with the blow, yet neverthelesse the cruell Barbarians, when they came into <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> beate and destroyed foure Regiments of Croatian Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, of which not ten Men escaped, and also the Regiment of <hi>Scharles,</hi> and hee himselfe mortally wounded; The Holsteiners beate themselves through them, those of <hi>Brym</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> saw these Heathens demaund the surrender of a principal Passe: and in the meane time almost all living thereabouts sought protection within their strong Walls and Gates. They also in the same time saw <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagelo Brokowits</hi> and <hi>Ostrowa</hi> stand all of a flame, the passage to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits, Zaromits</hi> and <hi>Paskowits,</hi> would hardly be secured by the felling of the Trees: The Prince of <hi>

In the meane time, the Turkes before <hi>Newhausell</hi> use their utmost force (and being taught by those, that had seene the same done in <hi>Europe</hi>) drained the Water of the <hi>Nap</hi> in the Moras out, though their great shott did little harme to those within, who tooke an oath to defend the same place to the utmost: in the interim the Imperiall Generall, Count <hi>Montecuculli</hi> lay sicke of a fevor at <hi>Presburgh:</hi> and the Hungarian Crown was for security carried out of that Cittie; Neither did the Turks escape free, one of their Visiers was before <hi>Newhausell</hi> shot through his side, many of the beleague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were killed, and the Grand <hi>Æ²isier</hi> of <hi>Offen</hi> grew extream sicke; who till now had detained with him, the Emperours Embassador, the Baron <hi>de Goes,</hi> to the end he might take notice, what power and forces the Turkish Emperour had there: the same <hi>de Goes</hi> had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confessor, who was a great Chymist and Philosopher, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himselfe to cure the <hi>Æ²isier,</hi> which tooke so good effect, that the <hi>Visier</hi> esteemed him as a Prophet or Saint, and would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suffer this father Confessor to goe from him. On the other side there came news to <hi>Prague</hi> that about the same time, the Turkish Emperour understanding that the Count <hi>Seryn,</hi> in <hi>Vespryn</hi> had beaten off the Turkish Leaguer, and would apparently by his great courage performe some notable Exploit, by invading of <hi>Turkey,</hi> caused a Cabinet to be presented to him, full (as the bearer hereof, who was a Turke said) of precious Stones; the Count <hi>Seryin</hi> well knowing the Turkish deceipts and faire wordes, was suspitious thereof; and that there was some treachery therein, yet he nevertheless resolved as a gratuity for this present, to release a Turke, who was a person of great quallity, and his Prisoner; desiring that the said released Turke before his departure should open the said Cabinet, which he doing, there came five shott or Bullets out of it, with which hee being wounded fell downe dead upon the ground, whereupon the Count <hi>Seryn</hi> perceiving the said treachery, fell with a considerable force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Turkey,</hi> and having killed many Turkes, returned with great
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205196:20"/> Booty into his Fortress, hereupon it was reported that the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians were agreed with this Count, and that they with thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men were ready to advance, for his assistance against the Turkes, but the same not yet Succeeding, those of <hi>Newhausell</hi> having been wearyed and spent almost sixs weeke space, and seeing also that there was such negligence to assist them, began to grow faint, the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians who were there within, hating the Austrians, opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against their Commander <hi>Forgats,</hi> it was said by many that he and the Germans were willing to fight; But his enemyes say he having correspondence with the Turks, did upon the 27 of <hi>September</hi> (when there was an intention to releive the place) sell the same for 60000 Duckets; for certain it is that it was to the great griefe of the Emperour and shame of the Hungarians, the selfe same day deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by agreement over to the Turkes, notwithstanding there was no want within the place, but well provided for a long time, and also with 130 piece of Cannon; there marched out 3500 Men to <hi>Comorra;</hi> The Turks were glad of this Victory, and gave every Hungarian who would stay within a Ducket, the same they also promised to the Countrey people in the Mountains, which well pleased those people, in somuch that in a short time a further invasion of the Turkes is to be expected: for the Austrians did much suspect strange Nations, who profferd their assistance against the Turks; There is a report that France proffered 12000, and the mutinous Polander would advance with 7000 Men, if there were money to pay them; also Swethland and Denmarke did offer to do their indeavors: But were not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, not withstanding, <hi>Austria, Bohemia, Sylesia,</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> lay now quite open to the Turkes, and that the Kingdome of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia,</hi> might be in a manner said to be totallyâª lost: God preserve the neighbouring places, and divert the haughtiness and selfe ends of the German Princes, the differences, discontents, and superfluous char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in their pompous Dyets and Councels, The persecutions and divisions of the Christians (who being in <hi>Turkey,</hi> are all of one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) and the miseries of the German Empire, and that for <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> sake, who (for a time but not alwayes) in former times by the Jewes and Infidels, and also now at present suffered, and suffereth himselfe to be martred and mocked: But like as the Jewes since the
